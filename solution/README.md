npm i
npm start
```

Note: solution is served at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/index.html) per [requirements](../README.md)

## Implementation Choices/Comments
- Dev env: pnpm, sirv, and esbuild for a fast, easy, and simple setup.
- DOM Framework: React with TypeScript.
- CSS Framework: None. I'm using the BEM syntax to demonstrate my CSS skills. In an enterprise setting, I would typically recommend a framework like Tailwind.
- Component Library: None. Most component libraries have a "look and feel" that may not match the designs. Additionally, I wanted to showcase my raw HTML/React skills. If I were to recommend a library, it would be ShadCDN.
- Form Library: react-hook-form. Forms are hard.
- File Structure: Simple as requested in requirements. Normally I would use a file structure that would properly separate out pages, features, modules, components, services, etc.
